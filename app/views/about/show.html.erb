"Are you hurting and broken within? <br>
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin? <br>
Jesus is calling <br>
Have you come to the end of yourself? <br>
Do you thirst for a drink from the well? <br>
Jesus is calling <br>
O come to the altar <br>
The Father's arms are open wide <br>
Forgiveness was bought with <br>
The precious blood of Jesus Christ" <br>
